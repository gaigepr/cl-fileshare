cl-fileshare
============

This is a web application/interface for sharing a directory tree. It is currently very much a work in progress.

I was inspired to make this because I run a sambda share for my roommates and myself. I wanted to be able to access the share files without being on my local network and also wanted to write something interesting and from scratch in common lisp. I have a lot of plans and goals for this project but I am willing to hear even more. Feedback is welcome!

Goals
=====
 * The ability to view/listen to/watch files from the browser and not just download them
 * Optional users/user authentication to access a single share
 * Multiple shares (per user, other ways possibley)
 * Integration with apache to make file downloads faster
